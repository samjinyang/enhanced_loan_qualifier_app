# Enhanced Loan Qualifier App

## *Introduction*

This app prompts the user for certain financial data in order to see which banks will be able to provide a loan to the user.  After the user inputs all the necessary data, the app will then prompt the user if they want to save their qualifying loans as CSV file.  The user can then enter the path of where they want to save the file if they choose to do so.
